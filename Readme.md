# Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images

## Sprint 1:
### Product Definition
#### 1) Product Mission
Build a model to classify cloud organization patterns from satellite images. If successful, you’ll help scientists to better understand how clouds will shape our future climate. This research will guide the development of next-generation models which could reduce uncertainties in climate projections.<br/>
#### 2) Target User(s)
•	 Climates scientists who want to better understand how clouds will shape our future climate.<br/><br/>
•	 Weather station that wants to provide more precise weather forecasting.<br/><br/>
•	 Companies that want to develop an APP that can forecast weather change for users by detecting a cloud image.<br/><br/>
#### 3) User Stories
As a climate scientist, I want to create a model to better classify cloud organization patterns from satellite images so I can project the future climate more precisely.<br/>
#### 4) MVP
**Major components:** A recognize pattern to learn and analyze cloud images.<br/><br/>
**Technology need to develop and analysis:** There are many ways in which clouds can organize, but the boundaries between different forms of organization are murky. This makes it challenging to build traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. <br/>
